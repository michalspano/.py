### What's inside?

- `cool-programs`: miscellaneous programs and scripts that I find interesting
  through the time.
- `intro-to-python`: a collection of simple programs and scripts for beginners
  focused on fundamental concepts of programming.
- `playground`: a 'sandbox' for testing new ideas and prototyping possible
  solutions to problems.

## My Story With `Python`

The first time I encountered a `Python` program was approximately in 2017. I
was in my first year of high school, and `Python` happened to be the language
of instruction for the 'Computer Science' class (in Slovak, the equivalent of
*'Informatika'*). At first, I felt highly overwhelmed by the dynamic nature of
the types in `Python`, having had some experience with **statically-typed**
languages. The first modules were mostly about the `Tkinter` library. In fact,
much of this repository is based on the lab exercises from my classes. Later
on, my fascination with `Python` grew rapidly. Today, it's a tool I see as
invaluable -- a tool I can use for scripting, prototyping, and I particularly
enjoy the seamless integration with `Jupyter` notebooks. I find it applicable
to most of domains I can think of. On the flip side, I am aware of its
limitations which include performance, lack of a static type system, etc. Above
all, `Python` is also a language suitable for beginners.
