## Cool Programs

This subfolder contains some interesting programs that I've written in my early
years with `Python`. These include:
- `argv.py`: using command-line arguments
- `box_blur.py`: image processing, applying a box blur filter
- `csv-file.py`: readin/writing CSV files programmatically
- `decorators.py`: a sample of using decorators
- `matplotlib`: an example of using `matplotlib` to plot a graph
- `qr-code.py`: programmatically generating QR codes
- `read-gspreadsheet`: reading Google spreadsheets with an API
- `sample-kivy-app`: two sample `Kivy` applications, a personal experiment 
  with the GUI library
-  `shell-python`: executing shell commands from Python
- `speech.py`: locally running tech-to-speech synthesis
