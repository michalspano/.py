## Introduction To `Python`

The following subfolder contains exercises from the first two years of my
high-school classes. The topics covered are:
- IO
- Functions
- Lists
- Images
- Math
- Tkinter, advanced attributes
- Image processing, manipulation

> [!NOTE]
> The number in the name of the subfolder (with exercises) indicates

The exercises are based on the books *"Creating with Python vol. 2"*,
*"Creating with Python vol. 3"* by Peter Kučera, Jaroslav Výbošťok. See
[here](http://creatingwithpython.com/eknihy.html) for more information.

The folder [`book-vol2-revision-exercises`](./book-vol2-revision-exercises)
contains my solutions to all the revision exercises from the 2nd volume of
the book.
